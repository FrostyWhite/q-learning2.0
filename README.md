# README file for C++ programming project

NOTE: Program must be built locally using Qt Creator. instructions can be
      found from installation.txt

The goal of our project was to teach a car to ride using a q-learning algorithm
and an artificial neural network. As claimed in our project plan, originally we
were supposed to reach at least the minimum requirements for the project.

The main parts of the software are the q-learning algorithm which is teaching
the neural network, graphics, physics and sensors for observing the surroundings
of the car. Now, at the end of this project we have these implemented and the
program is working as hoped for. The car is driving on its own and it’s
learning to drive without crashing into walls or driving too fast. We’ve also
added a possibility to save the car’s progress to a file.
