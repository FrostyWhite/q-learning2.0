For the moment being the project is not yet deployed
so it probably needs to be built locally. Unfortunately this process
takes more effort than it should. Building the deployed applications
was proven to be too hard as the qt uses its own method of building that
did not as expected on our platforms due to some confusion with the qt
libraries. The executables could not be built using command line.
